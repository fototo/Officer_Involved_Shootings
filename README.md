# Officer Involved Shootings April 2015

**Shiny Document displaying some of the HTML Widgets that are Available**

Running Example: [Officer Involved Shootings](https://yxes.shinyapps.io/Officer_Involved_Shootings_Apr_2015/)

Using data gleaned from the [Gun Violence Archive](http://www.gunviolencearchive.org/) for the arbitrary timeframe
of March 17th, 2015 through April 12th, 2015, this project details the process of cleaning the data headers, 
combining it with additional data from Google Maps and then delivering it as a dynamic report using R and Shiny.

The report overviews the use of 4 [HTML Widgets](http://www.htmlwidgets.org/) including:

* [DataTables](https://yxes.shinyapps.io/Officer_Involved_Shootings_Apr_2015/#datatable)
* [dygraphs](https://yxes.shinyapps.io/Officer_Involved_Shootings_Apr_2015/#timeseries)
* [network3D](https://yxes.shinyapps.io/Officer_Involved_Shootings_Apr_2015/#d3graph)
* [leaflet](https://yxes.shinyapps.io/Officer_Involved_Shootings_Apr_2015/#leaflet)

[Feedback](https://yxes.shinyapps.io/Officer_Involved_Shootings_Apr_2015/#author) is welcome including
suggestions to extend the dataset using other HTML Widgets.
