```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(BH)
library(shiny)

copShot = read.csv("copshot_complete.csv")
copShot$date <- as.Date(copShot$date)
```

The title is a bit misleading as the actual dataset contains all incidents where
both a firearm and an officer were present in a potential crime.  "Potential"
because in the U.S. an individual is presumed innocent until proven otherwise.
This does not necesarily mean that the firearm was even discharged.  We have
tried to display incidents where the results ended in *death* or *injury* as
separate displays where appropriate and keep our results as interactive as
possible allowing the reader to explore the resulting dataset without bias from
the author.

#### Observations

* `r 50 - sum(! duplicated(copShot[,"state"]))` States have no recorded incidents
* Total number of recorded incidents were `r dim(copShot)[1]`
* The largest number of people injured during a  single incident was 
`r max(copShot$injured)`
* The largest number of deaths were `r max(copShot$killed)`
* `r sum(!copShot$injured & !copShot$killed)` incidents did not result in death or injury

### Data Sources

The following dataset orginally came from the 
<a href="http://www.gunviolencearchive.org/" target="_new">Gun Violence Archive</a>
public report at <br>
[ http://www.gunviolencearchive.org/officer-involved-shootings ]<br>
on `r format(max(copShot$date), "%b %d, %Y")` and contains only the previous
`r max(copShot$date) - min(copShot$date)` days of data as **I have been
unable to get in contact with the GVA<sup>&#42;</sup>** to request a more complete
dataset.

&#42;(*If you can, I'd be in your debt - <a href="#author">contact me</a>*)

#### Manipulations...

The headers were cleaned up to contain only lower-cased single words, 
dates were reformatted as yyyy-mm-dd so they could easily be read into R and
then the following columns were added:

* postalcode
* display_address
* latitude
* longitude

<img src="img/badge.jpg" align=right width=200>

The data for these columns were pulled from Google's map API using the
address, city and state values and if any data point was missing
it returned the best approximation.

<a name="datatable"></a>

### Final Data Table

Here's the final breakdown of the resulting dataset, such that you can
search it and page through it at your leisure. The columns can be 
manipulated individually so they fit on the screen, simply select
the ones you wish to display and go back *Table Display* to review
your changes.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height=25, out.height=25}
shinyApp(
  ui = navbarPage(
    title="DataTable",
    tabPanel('Table Display',
             dataTableOutput('shootings')
             ) ,
    tabPanel('Columns',
             checkboxGroupInput('disp_cols',
                                'Select Columns',
                                names(copShot),
                                selected = names(copShot)[1:6])
             )
    
  ),
  server = function(input, output) {
    output$shootings = renderDataTable(
      copShot[, input$disp_cols, drop=FALSE],
      options = list(
        lengthMenu = list(c(5,10,25,50,100), c('minimal','little','bunch','lots','overload')),
        pageLength = 5
      )
    )
  },
  options = list(height = 500)
)
```

### Frequency Fluctuations over Time

<img src="img/bullet.jpg" align=right width=200>

This is a breakdown of the shootings over time.  There's a checkbox for each incident so if
for instance, you select **deaths** you will see a frequency count of the number of deaths
for each day of the selected timeframe.  The other two will add to that chart.  If none of
the entries are selected then you'll simply see the total of all incidents.

Scrolling down in this window displays three linked graphs for each incident.  This means
that if you select a range in any one graph, the same range is paired with the other two.

### Daily Incident Locations Network

Here we get a feel for the location of incidents over a given day.
The center of the web displays the date while the branches are made
up of the *State*, *City* and *Address* within that city.

```{r, echo=FALSE}

### Incident Map

Here's a map of the US with the incidents plotted.  You can change the
date ranges to see how things change over time and select different 
incidents for review.  Each incident contains a link to the original 
data source and those source pages contain a link to the story that 
provides details about the event.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
